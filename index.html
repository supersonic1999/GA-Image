        <p>Biological algorithms are a complex set of constantly evolving systems that have many uses within the real world, specifically this project was started to investigate the power of these algorithms in image synthesis and improve upon existing implementations. </p>

<p>The project was split into two halves, the 1st involved an in depth research phase detailing a range of biological algorithms and the 2nd focusing on design and implementation of said algorithm along with a conclusive evaluation of the final product and any relevant processes. </p>

<p>The result is a high quality detached program that efficiently generates an approximation of a source image over many genetic generations. This was achieved in the face of a lack of research available specifically aimed at similar types of image synthesis and hopefully this will aid future research.</p>
